# CS-1-Compilers

Stanford's online platform __Stanford Lagunita__ is shutting down on "at 12 noon Pacific Time on March 31, 2020." After this day, several courses listed on the site will not be available for free anwhyere on the internet (atleast to my knowledge). One course in particular that has always intrigued me is __CS 1 Compilers__ taught by Alex Aiken. I, unfortunately, never had the opportunity to work on the course in the past.

As a result of the devastating COVID-19 outbreak, my university has been closed for at least two weeks. My friends and I quickly realized that this two week break quite nicely coincides with the closing of Lagunita.

We have two weeks to complete a ten week course.

## Lets do this. ðŸ’ª
